                    <p class="bookDescription">
                        The C Programming Language By Dennis M Ritchie and Brian W Kernighan is an excellent book 
                        for both new comers and expert programmers. The book is packed with many examples, and 
                        yet is small and concise. The book is written by the person that created the language, 
                        so there is no better source of information. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who
                        wishes to become a C Programmer.

                         Database design. SQL is the primary language used for talking to databases, 
                         and this book explains the language in detail. Whether you are a novice or
                         advanced SQL developer, you will learn a lot from this book.

                     <p class="bookDescription">Java programming could not be easier with this book. This was the first book I 
                         ever read when it came to learning Java. I can tell you from experience that I 
                         have <strong>NEVER</strong> read a better book than this one when it came to learning 
                         Java. Java is a tough language to learn but this book makes it easy. Click on the
